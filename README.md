git clone https://github.com/SurajKumarpandey001/Voice-Translator
cd voice-translator
Run the Python script:
python your_script_name.py
A prompt will appear asking for the source and destination language codes (e.g., en, fr, es, etc.). After that, just start speaking!

🧠 How It Works
Captures voice input from the user via microphone.
Uses SpeechRecognition with Google’s speech-to-text API to convert speech to text.
Translates the text using the translate module.
Converts the translated text to speech using gTTS.
Plays the audio using pygame.

📌 Note
Requires an internet connection for Google APIs (speech recognition and translation).
Ensure your microphone is properly connected and working.
Background noise can affect speech recognition accuracy.
